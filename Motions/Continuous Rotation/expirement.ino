/*

We can reduce the amount of code we have used to create our speed control. As an experiment for this activity, letâ€™s make our program shorter. To do this, we will need to map the speed of the servo in function of the distance we are measuring with the distance sensor.

We only need to use the if/else statement to identify when the servo has to move forwards or backwards and when it is in the targeted position.
